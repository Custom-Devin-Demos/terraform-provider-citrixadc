## Argument Reference

* `name` - (Required) Name for the new session policy that is applied after the user logs on to Citrix Gateway.
* `action` - (Required) Action to be applied by the new session policy if the rule criteria are met.
* `rule` - (Required) Expression, or name of a named expression, specifying the traffic that matches the policy.  The following requirements apply only to the Citrix ADC CLI: * If the expression includes one or more spaces, enclose the entire expression in double quotation marks. * If the expression itself includes double quotation marks, escape the quotations by using the \ character.  * Alternatively, you can use single quotation marks to enclose the rule, in which case you do not have to escape the double quotation marks.

* `id` - The id of the vpnsessionpolicy. It has the same value as the `name` attribute.
