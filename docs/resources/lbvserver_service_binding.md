```hcl
resource "citrixadc_lbvserver" "tf_lbvserver" {
  ipv46       = "10.10.10.33"
  name        = "tf_lbvserver"
  port        = 80
  servicetype = "HTTP"
}

resource "citrixadc_service" "tf_service" {
  name = "tf_service"
  ip = "192.168.43.33"
  servicetype  = "HTTP"
  port = 80
}

resource "citrixadc_lbvserver_service_binding" "tf_binding" {
  name = citrixadc_lbvserver.tf_lbvserver.name
  servicename = citrixadc_service.tf_service.name
  weight = 1
  order = 10
}
```


## Argument Reference

* `servicename` - (Required) Service to bind to the virtual server.
* `weight` - (Optional) Weight to assign to the specified service.
* `order` - (Optional) Order number to be assigned to the service when it is bound to the lb vserver.
* `name` - (Required) Name for the virtual server. Must begin with an ASCII alphanumeric or underscore (\_) character, and must contain only ASCII alphanumeric, underscore, hash (#), period (.), space, colon (:), at sign (@), equal sign (=), and hyphen (-) characters.
