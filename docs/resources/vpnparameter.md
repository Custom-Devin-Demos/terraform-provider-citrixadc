* `backendserversni` - (Optional) enables sni extension for backend server handshakes
* `citrixreceiverhome` - (Optional) Web address for the Citrix Receiver home page. Configure Citrix Gateway so that when users log on to the appliance, the Citrix Gateway Plug-in opens a web browser that allows single sign-on to the Citrix Receiver home page.
* `clientchoices` - (Optional) Provide users with multiple logon options. With client choices, users have the option of logging on by using the Citrix Gateway Plug-in for Windows, Citrix Gateway Plug-in for Java, the Web Interface, or clientless access from one location. Depending on how Citrix Gateway is configured, users are presented with up to three icons for logon choices. The most common are the Citrix Gateway Plug-in for Windows, Web Interface, and clientless access.
* `clientcleanupprompt` - (Optional) Prompt for client-side cache clean-up when a client-initiated session closes.
* `clientconfiguration` - (Optional) Allow users to change client Debug logging level in Configuration tab of the Citrix Gateway Plug-in for Windows.
* `clientdebug` - (Optional) Set the trace level on Citrix Gateway. Technical support technicians use these debug logs for in-depth debugging and troubleshooting purposes. Available settings function as follows:  * DEBUG - Detailed debug messages are collected and written into the specified file. * STATS - Application audit level error messages and debug statistic counters are written into the specified file.  * EVENTS - Application audit-level error messages are written into the specified file.  * OFF - Only critical events are logged into the Windows Application Log.
* `clientidletimeout` - (Optional) Time, in minutes, after which to time out the user session if Citrix Gateway does not detect mouse or keyboard activity.
* `clientlessmodeurlencoding` - (Optional) When clientless access is enabled, you can choose to encode the addresses of internal web applications or to leave the address as clear text. Available settings function as follows:  * OPAQUE - Use standard encoding mechanisms to make the domain and protocol part of the resource unclear to users.  * TRANSPARENT - Do not encode the web address and make it visible to users.  * ENCRYPT - Allow the domain and protocol to be encrypted using a session key. When the web address is encrypted, the URL is different for each user session for the same web resource. If users bookmark the encoded web address, save it in the web browser and then log off, they cannot connect to the web address when they log on and use the bookmark. If users save the encrypted bookmark in the Access Interface during their session, the bookmark works each time the user logs on.
* `clientlesspersistentcookie` - (Optional) State of persistent cookies in clientless access mode. Persistent cookies are required for accessing certain features of SharePoint, such as opening and editing Microsoft Word, Excel, and PowerPoint documents hosted on the SharePoint server. A persistent cookie remains on the user device and is sent with each HTTP request. Citrix Gateway encrypts the persistent cookie before sending it to the plug-in on the user device, and refreshes the cookie periodically as long as the session exists. The cookie becomes stale if the session ends. Available settings function as follows:  * ALLOW - Enable persistent cookies. Users can open and edit Microsoft documents stored in SharePoint.  * DENY - Disable persistent cookies. Users cannot open and edit Microsoft documents stored in SharePoint.  * PROMPT - Prompt users to allow or deny persistent cookies during the session. Persistent cookies are not required for clientless access if users do not connect to SharePoint.
* `clientlessvpnmode` - (Optional) Enable clientless access for web, XenApp or XenDesktop, and FileShare resources without installing the Citrix Gateway Plug-in.

* `clientoptions` - (Optional) Display only the configured menu options when you select the "Configure Citrix Gateway" option in the Citrix Gateway Plug-in's system tray icon for Windows.
* `clientsecurity` - (Optional) Specify the client security check for the user device to permit a Citrix Gateway session. The web address or IP address is not included in the expression for the client security check.
* `clientsecuritygroup` - (Optional) The client security group that will be assigned on failure of the client security check. Users can in general be organized into Groups. In this case, the Client Security Group may have a more restrictive security policy.
* `clientsecuritylog` - (Optional) Specifies whether or not to display all failed Client Security scans to the end user
* `clientsecuritymessage` - (Optional) The client security message that will be displayed on failure of the client security check.
* `clientversions` - (Optional) checkversion api
* `defaultauthorizationaction` - (Optional) Specify the network resources that users have access to when they log on to the internal network. The default setting for authorization is to deny access to all network resources. Citrix recommends using the default global setting and then creating authorization policies to define the network resources users can access. If you set the default authorization policy to DENY, you must explicitly authorize access to any network resource, which improves security.
* `dnsvservername` - (Optional) Name of the DNS virtual server for the user session.

You can configure a DNS suffix to append to the user name when the DNS record is added to the cache. You can reach to the host from where the user is logged on by using the user's name, which can be easier to remember than an IP address. When the user logs off from Citrix Gateway, the record is removed from the DNS cache.
* `kcdaccount` - (Optional) The KCD account details to be used in SSO
* `killconnections` - (Optional) Specify whether the Citrix Gateway Plug-in should disconnect all preexisting connections, such as the connections existing before the user logged on to Citrix Gateway, and prevent new incoming connections on the Citrix Gateway Plug-in for Windows and MAC when the user is connected to Citrix Gateway and split tunneling is disabled.
* `linuxpluginupgrade` - (Optional) Option to set plugin upgrade behaviour for Linux
* `locallanaccess` - (Optional) Set local LAN access. If split tunneling is OFF, and you set local LAN access to ON, the local client can route traffic to its local interface. When the local area network switch is specified, this combination of switches is useful. The client can allow local LAN access to devices that commonly have non-routable addresses, such as local printers or local file servers.
* `loginscript` - (Optional) Path to the logon script that is run when a session is established. Separate multiple scripts by using comma. A "$" in the path signifies that the word following the "$" is an environment variable.

* `splittunnel` - (Optional) Send, through the tunnel, traffic only for intranet applications that are defined in Citrix Gateway. Route all other traffic directly to the Internet. The OFF setting routes all traffic through Citrix Gateway. With the REVERSE setting, intranet applications define the network traffic that is not intercepted. All network traffic directed to internal IP addresses bypasses the VPN tunnel, while other traffic goes through Citrix Gateway. Reverse split tunneling can be used to log all non-local LAN traffic. For example, if users have a home network and are logged on through the Citrix Gateway Plug-in, network traffic destined to a printer or another device within the home network is not intercepted.
* `spoofiip` - (Optional) Indicate whether or not the application requires IP spoofing, which routes the connection to the intranet application through the virtual adapter.
* `sslproxy` - (Optional) IP address of the proxy server to be used for SSL access for all subsequent connections to the internal network.
